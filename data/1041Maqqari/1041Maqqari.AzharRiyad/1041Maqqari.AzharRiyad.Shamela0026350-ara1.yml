90#VERS#COMMENT##: There is no edition listed on worldcat published in
    1939, both the above refer to 1904, but it is the same pagination, etc.
    Good correspondence with no obvious errors. However, I found
    distinguishing between what should be hierarchical sections vs. semantic
    units somewhat difficult and this should be checked.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I tagged the text again (It's not easy to tag this text. A lot of titles should be added by closely reading the text to accurately divide the subject matters).  2- The fourth volume is missing. I added the lable “text quality” to the issue for this text. 3- I fixed the Worldcat links. The collated version is a reprint of the based version.

90#VERS#COMMENT##: There is no edition listed on worldcat published in
        1939, both the above refer to 1904, but it is the same pagination, etc.
        Good correspondence with no obvious errors. However, I found
        distinguishing between what should be hierarchical sections vs. semantic
        units somewhat difficult and this should be checked.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
